answer: {Louis XV} [or {Louis the} Well-{Beloved} or {Louis le Bien-Aime}]

This king's chief adviser was said to have “put [France] on a diet" and abolished the unpopular cinquantième tax imposed by the Duke of Bourbon. Rene de Maupeou's "triumvirate" tried to reduce the stalling power of the Parlements under this king, who married Marie Leszczynska after the death of Philippe d'Orleans. The founding of the Banque General and collapse of the Mississippi Bubble during the early reign of this king, served by Cardinal (*) Fleury, led to the fall of John Law. Those events took place during the eight-year regency of this king, who came to the throne at age five and was significantly influenced by his mistress, the Madame de Pompadour. For 10 points, name this French king whose successor was executed in the French Revolution.

Iodine and Xenon lie at the base of a valley of stability in which this process does not occur. Neutron stars would degenerate in 10 minutes through this process if all electron states weren't filled in the core. This phenomenon was used to derive Fermi’s Golden Rule. The NEMO-3 experiment searches for a variant of it that can only occur if the neutrino is its own antiparticle. This process uses an intermediate W boson to transform a (*) down quark into an up quark or vice versa. This phenomenon, which is responsible for changing carbon-14 to nitrogen-14 with a half-life of 5700 years, changes the atomic number by one but leaves the atomic mass constant. For 10 points, name this phenomenon in which a nucleus emits either a positron or an electron.

answer: {hyphae} [sing. {hypha}]

These structures are flattened in order to form appressoria. The growth of these structures is directed by an aggregation of microtubules and endosomal vesicles called the spitzenkorper. Specialized ones with sharp tips used to penetrate hosts are called haustoria, and these structures can form Hartig nets during symbiosis. Coenocytic ones lack (*) septa, and those belonging to the causative agent of aspergillosis tend to branch at forty-five degrees. Generative ones are used for reproduction, which is accomplished by fusing cells together to form a heterokaryon. For 10 points, name these chitinous structures which interconnect to form a mycelium, small threads that make up the main body of a fungus.

answer: {convergence} [or other word forms of {"converge"}]

For finite difference methods applied to PDEs, this property is equivalent to stability according to the Lax equivalence theorem. The Weierstrass M-test can be used to test for this property. A sequence of real numbers has this property if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence. For a series with both positive and negative terms, the (*) “absolute” form of this property is stronger than the usual form, only requiring that the terms go to zero. This property is possessed everywhere by the Taylor series for the exponential function, while other power series may have some finite “radius of” this property. Common tests to determine this property include the ratio test and the root test. For 10 points, give this mathematical term for approaching a limit.

This process can be combined with a DART source, and that type uses Ultramark 1621 to calibrate. During one stage of this procedure, compounds with a gamma hydrogen will rearrange to form an enol radical, and compounds can also undergo retro-Diels-Alder reactions while undergoing it. This procedure follows gas chromatography in many setups. The first stage of this procedure creates a radical cation called the (*) molecular ion, which fragments into the base peak. In this procedure, if the m-over-z ratio is odd, then the molecule usually has an odd number of nitrogen atoms. In this process, ions are deflected by an external magnetic field into the detector.

The sd-1 “green revolution” rice mutant has a defect in the production of these hormones. The synthesis of these compounds requires the cyclization of geranylgeranyl disphosphate to kaurene. These hormones facilitate the action of PIFs during the etiolation response by triggering the degradation of DELLA proteins. They were originally discovered due to fungal infections in rice causing chlorosis, a condition called (*) foolish seedling disease or bakanae. These hormones trigger the synthesis of amylase in the aleurone layer when water is available, antagonizing the function of abciscic acid.
